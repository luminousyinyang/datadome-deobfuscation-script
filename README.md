# DataDome-Deobb-Script
Starting to learn deobfuscation. So my project to do is deobfuscating DataDome. One of the easier antibots to start off with for deobfuscaiton.

The purpose of renaming all the vars was for mapping purposes to give myself a visualization of whats going on. With every DD script update though the hexadecimal var names change so renaming doesnt transfer over. There is obviously a better way to do this but the purpose of this project was just to test out deobfuscation and give myself a visualization of how this script works.

Datadome version 4.6.11
